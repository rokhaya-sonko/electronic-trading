# Electronic Trading 

This repository documents my personal and structured journey into **electronic trading**,
with a focus on **execution algorithms**, **market microstructure**, and **post-trade analytics**.

It is not meant to be a production-ready framework.

## Why this repository?

I created this project to:

- Learn by **implementing**
- Explore execution algorithms in a hands-on way (TWAP, VWAP, POV, IS…)
- Understand how trades are evaluated using benchmarks and metrics
